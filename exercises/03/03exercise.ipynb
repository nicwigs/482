    "# Exercise 3 (Due: January 25, 2019 before midnight)\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this exercise is to help you get familiar with MongoDB and the pymongo library. Follow the instructions below to complete the exercise. Use the template notebook below to write and execute your python program. Submit the notebook via D2L. Make sure the notebook also displays the query results. You should also convert the notebook to HTML and submit the HTML file as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you need to write a Jupyter notebook script that will open a sample data file named bike_rental.csv data file and store the data in MongoDB. You will also write a few simple queries to retrieve information from the database. The original dataset was obtained from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bike+sharing+dataset. The sample data contain the total number of bike rentals on each day for a 2-year period from 2011 to 2012. There should be 7 columns (fields) in the sample file: *date, season, holiday, weekday, workingday, weather, and rentalcount*. Make sure you use the sample data from the class website instead of the original raw data."

    "- For each subsequent lines, extract the corresponding fields and store them in a dictionary object named *record*. Note that all the fields must be stored as integer-valued except for date, which is a string. Use pymongo to insert the record into a collection named \"bike\" in MongoDB.\n",
