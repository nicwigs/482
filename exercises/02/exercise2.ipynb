    "The purpose of this exercise is to help you get familiar with the Python tweepy library for downloading data from Twitter. Follow the instructions below to complete the exercise. Use the template notebook below to write and execute your python program. Rename the template file as exercise2.ipynb and submit it via D2L. You should also convert the notebook to PDF or HTML and submit the converted file as well."

    "**Step 2.** Following the Python tweepy example given in the lecture, use the Twitter Search (REST) API to download 30 most recent tweets from the Twitter feed of “CDCgov”..  This can be done by changing the keyword string given in the sample code to “from:CDCgov”. For more information about the query term to use, read the documentation available at https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/search. Make sure you install tweepy on your machine before running the code. Save the text messages of the returned tweets into an ASCII text file named cdc.txt. **Make sure you save only the text part of the tweet message NOT the entire JSON message** (which includes username, coordinates, etc). See the example given in the lecture notes on how to access the text part of the tweets.  The following is an example about how to save a string into a file:\n",
