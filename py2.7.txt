Then you need to copy all the cells over from your old exercise to this new notebook. But first copy over the following to make sure it works now. Then you should be all set!

uname = "cse482"
pwd = "cse482"
hname = "localhost"
dbname = "cse482"

import mysql.connector
from mysql.connector import errorcode

try:
    cnx = mysql.connector.connect(user=uname, password=pwd, host=hname, database=dbname)
    cursor = cnx.cursor()
    query = "DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Health"
    cursor.execute(query)

    query = """ CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Health
                (TweetID BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
                UserID BIGINT,
                Message VARCHAR(200)) 
            """
    cursor.execute(query)
    cursor.close()
    cnx.close()
    
except mysql.connector.Error as e:
    print(e.msg)       # error message
